# 🤖 Automation AI Agent (Gemini-powered)

This project is a lightweight **AI-powered task automation framework** that uses **Google Gemini Flash 2.0** to generate task instructions and executes them via Python automation scripts.  

Currently, the system can **open Notepad and type a predefined message** step by step. The structure is modular, allowing you to add more tasks like browser automation, screenshots, or system-level actions.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automation_ai_agent.git
cd automation_ai_agent
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Gemini API Key

Open **`config.py`** and add your Gemini API key:

```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Automation

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📝 Example Task

The AI agent is given a **task description**, and then executes it with Python automation.

### Current Example:

```
Open Notepad and type the following text exactly as written:

"Automation works with Gemini AI!
This project demonstrates intelligent task automation.
Step-by-step execution is running successfully."
```

Result → Notepad opens and the above text is typed automatically ✅

## 💡 Contribution

Want to add more tasks?

1. Create a new file under `tasks/` (e.g., `browser_task.py`)
2. Implement a `run()` function inside it
3. Import and call it in `main.py`

Do you want me to also include **GIF screenshots / demo images** section in the README so it looks cooler on GitHub?
